<h2>Description</h2>
<p>You must make these strawberry mousse shooters—it just doesn’t get much easier than this for a simple, yet elegant dessert. I like to pipe the mousse into shooter glasses for a lovely presentation. This also may be served in small dessert dishes, but remember, EVERYBODY has room for a mini dessert.<p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>10 ounces fresh strawberries - trimmed, rinsed, and quartered</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/4 cup confectioner's sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons strawberry preserves</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
    <li>fresh mint and extra chopped strawberries for garnish (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Add strawberries and sugar to a blender, process to a fine puree, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Beat heavy whipping cream in a chilled bowl using chilled beaters until frothy. Add confectioners sugar, strawberry preserves, and almond extract, and continue to beat until stiff peaks form, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the strawberry puree equally to the shooter glasses, about a quarter to a third of the way up. Spoon or pipe the mousse on top of the puree, and garnish with fresh mint and strawberries, if using. Move to the fridge to chill.</li>
</ol>
